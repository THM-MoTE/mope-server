\section{Introduction}
This document describes the protocol between Mo|E-Server process and clients.
Clients are going to communicate with the server process by sending HTTP calls to the server.
The server does nothing without a initial ``connect'' request. After a ``connect'' request the server
is ready to compile Modelica files and Modelica Script files. A ``disconnect'' request stops the server
from working with the project.
