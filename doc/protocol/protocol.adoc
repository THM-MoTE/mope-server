== Introduction
This document describes the protocol between Mo|E-Server process and clients.
Clients are going to communicate with the server process by sending HTTP calls to the server.
The server does nothing without a initial _connect_ request. After a _connect_ request the server
is ready to compile Modelica files and Modelica Script files. A _disconnect_ request stops the server
from working with the project.

== Protocol
All requests and responses are using *JSON-Strings* as data.
Detailed error messages are returned as _plain text_.
